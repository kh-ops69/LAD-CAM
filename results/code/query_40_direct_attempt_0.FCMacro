# Step 1: Create a new document
doc = App.newDocument()

# Step 2: Sketch the basic shape of the pen body
pen_body = Part.makeCylinder(5, 100)  # Assuming diameter of 10mm and length of 100mm

# Step 3: Extrude the sketch to create the solid body of the pen
pen_solid = pen_body.extrude(App.Vector(0, 0, 100))

# Step 4: Add details such as the clip, button, and grip textures to the pen body
clip = Part.makeBox(2, 10, 5)  # Assuming dimensions for the clip
clip.translate(App.Vector(0, 0, 100))  # Position the clip at the top of the pen body
pen_solid = pen_solid.fuse(clip)  # Add the clip to the pen body

button = Part.makeCylinder(3, 2)  # Assuming dimensions for the button
button.translate(App.Vector(0, 0, 5))  # Position the button at the bottom of the pen body
pen_solid = pen_solid.fuse(button)  # Add the button to the pen body

# Step 5: Sketch the nib of the pen
nib = Part.makeCylinder(1, 5)  # Assuming dimensions for the nib

# Step 6: Extrude the nib sketch to create the nib
nib_solid = nib.extrude(App.Vector(0, 0, 5))

# Step 7: Assemble the nib to the pen body
nib_solid.translate(App.Vector(0, 0, 105))  # Position the nib at the tip of the pen body
pen_with_nib = pen_solid.fuse(nib_solid)  # Attach the nib to the pen body

# Step 8: Add any final details or adjustments to the overall design (if needed)

# Step 9: Check the model for any errors or inconsistencies

# Step 10: Save and export the CAD model of the ballpoint pen with a nib
