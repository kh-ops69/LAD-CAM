import Part

# Step 1: Create a new document
doc = App.newDocument()

# Step 2: Create a sphere with a radius of 25mm
sphere = Part.makeSphere(25)

# Step 3: Create a cube with sides of 50mm
cube = Part.makeBox(50, 50, 50)

# Step 4: Position the sphere and cube to fuse at one face
cube.Placement.Base = App.Vector(0, 0, 25)

# Step 5: Use Boolean operation to unite the sphere and cube
combined_shape = sphere.fuse(cube)

# Step 6: Show the final shape
Part.show(combined_shape)
