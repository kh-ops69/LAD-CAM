# Step 1: Create a new document
doc = App.newDocument()

# Step 2: Sketch a square with 20mm sides for the base of the pyramid
square = Part.makePolygon(4, True, 20)
square_face = Part.Face(square)

# Step 3: Extrude the square sketch to a height of 30mm to create the base of the pyramid
base = square_face.extrude(App.Vector(0, 0, 30))

# Step 4: Sketch a triangle on top of the square base with a height of 30mm
triangle_points = [App.Vector(0, 0, 30), App.Vector(10, 20, 30), App.Vector(20, 0, 30)]
triangle = Part.makePolygon(triangle_points, True)
triangle_face = Part.Face(triangle)

# Step 5: Create a ruled surface between the square base and the triangle to form the faces of the pyramid
pyramid = base.makeLoft([triangle_face])

# Step 6: Hide or delete any unnecessary sketches or construction lines

# Step 7: Show the 3D model of the pyramid
Part.show(pyramid)
