# Step 1: Create a new document
doc = App.newDocument()

# Step 2: Sketch the NACA 0010 airfoil profile
sketch = doc.addObject("Sketcher::SketchObject", "Sketch")
sketch.addGeometry(Part.Circle(App.Vector(0, 0, 0), App.Vector(0, 0, 1), 1), False)  # Example sketch, replace with NACA 0010 airfoil profile

# Step 3: Extrude the airfoil profile to create the main wing shape
wire = sketch.Shape.Wires[0]  # Corrected the reference to the sketch object
face = Part.Face(wire)
wing_shape = face.extrude(FreeCAD.Vector(0, 0, 100))  # Example extrusion length, adjust as needed

# Step 4: Add additional features
# Add wingtips, mounting points, control surfaces, etc.

# Step 5: Create internal structures or ribs
# Add ribs or internal structures for support and strength

# Step 6: Finalize the design
# Add necessary details and refine the overall shape

# Step 7: Review and make adjustments

# Step 8: Export the CAD model
