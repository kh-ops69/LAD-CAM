# Step 1: Create a new document
doc = App.newDocument()

# Step 2: Sketch the overall shape of the ballpoint pen including the body and the cap
body_sketch = doc.addObject("Sketcher::SketchObject", "BodySketch")
# Add your sketching code for the body here

# Step 3: Extrude the sketch to create a solid body for the pen
body_wire = body_sketch.Shape.Wires[0] if body_sketch.Shape.Wires else None
if body_wire:
    body_face = Part.Face(body_wire)
    pen_body = body_face.extrude(FreeCAD.Vector(0,0,100))  # Adjust the extrusion height as needed

# Step 4: Create a separate sketch for the nib of the pen
nib_sketch = doc.addObject("Sketcher::SketchObject", "NibSketch")
# Add your sketching code for the nib here

# Step 5: Extrude or revolve the sketch to create the nib
nib_wire = nib_sketch.Shape.Wires[0] if nib_sketch.Shape.Wires else None
if nib_wire:
    nib_face = Part.Face(nib_wire)
    pen_nib = nib_face.extrude(FreeCAD.Vector(0,0,20))  # Adjust the extrusion height as needed

# Step 6: Add details such as the clip, button, and any other features of the pen
# Add your code to create these details

# Step 7: Finalize the design by adjusting dimensions and adding any necessary details
# Add your final adjustments and details here

# Step 8: Verify the design and make any final modifications if needed
doc.recompute()

# Step 9: 3D print or render the model to visualize the final product
