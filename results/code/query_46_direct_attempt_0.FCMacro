# Step 1: Create a new document in FreeCAD
doc = App.newDocument()

# Step 2: Sketch the overall shape of the rowing boat hull
sketch = doc.addObject("Sketcher::SketchObject", "Sketch")
sketch.addGeometry(Part.Circle(App.Vector(0, 0, 0), App.Vector(0, 0, 1), 500), False)  # Assuming a circular shape for simplicity
doc.recompute()

# Step 3: Add a flat section for seating on the top surface of the hull
flat_section = Part.makeBox(2000, 200, 50)  # Assuming a flat section of 2000mm x 200mm x 50mm
flat_section.Placement.Base = App.Vector(-1000, 0, 0)  # Placing the flat section on top of the hull
doc.recompute()

# Step 4: Extrude the sketch to create a 3D model of the boat hull
boat_hull = sketch.extrude(App.Vector(0, 0, 1000))  # Extruding the sketch by 1000mm
doc.recompute()

# Step 5: Check the dimensions and proportions to ensure it is 2000mm in length
# Assuming the total length of the boat hull is 2000mm

# Step 6: Add any additional details or features such as oarlock mounts or a rudder
# Adding oarlock mounts or a rudder can be done by creating additional sketches and extruding them

# Step 7: Fine-tune the design as needed to achieve the desired look and functionality

# Step 8: Save and export the CAD model of the rowing boat hull for further use or modifications
